This repository contains a set of SQL queries for the Adventure Works database. The Adventure Works database schema can be found [here](https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/adventureworks/index.php).

The queries are categorized based on their complexity into easy, medium, and hard sets, covering various topics.

## Easy

### Joins
Understanding and using different types of SQL joins, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns.

### Procedures
Creating and executing stored procedures, precompiled sets of one or more SQL statements that can be reused, to enhance code modularity and maintainability.

### Functions
Exploring SQL functions to perform specific operations, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulations, and date/time manipulations, within SQL queries.

## Medium

### Cross Apply
Utilizing CROSS APPLY to evaluate a table-valued function for each row of a table expression, providing a powerful mechanism for complex queries and data transformations.

### Merge
Using the MERGE statement to perform insert, update, or delete operations on a target table based on the results of a join with a source table, streamlining data synchronization.

### CTE (Common Table Expressions)
Leveraging Common Table Expressions to create named temporary result sets within SQL queries, enhancing readability and simplifying complex queries.

## Hard

### Ranking Functions
Applying ranking functions, such as ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK(), to assign a rank to each row within a partition of the result set, facilitating advanced result set analysis.

### Views
Creating and utilizing views, which are virtual tables derived from the result of a SELECT query, to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and provide an abstraction layer over underlying tables.
